# The libraries which should be linked to the current project. The link type is
# specified as a global parameter, except the libraries, which are built as a
# either shared or static library. For those libraries the appropriate linking
# type is selected, e.g. if current project is being linked to lib_project,
# which is static library, then current project will be always linked to
# lib_project statically, despite global link type is shared or static.

# libs := project1 tcl gtkmm-2.4
